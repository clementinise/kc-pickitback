<1.2>
- New Config option called PreventItemPickupByGender: "Prevent players from picking up items if their character's gender does not match the item's designated gender (This is a short-term solution to avoid mismatch when picking up hats/glasses due to the game having different IDs per gender)"
- New Config option called SendToAllPlayers: "Should the event be sent to all players or only 'active' physical players known to the client? (I recommend setting this to false if you have a 30+ player server, but it may result in worse sync for far away players)"

- Improved performance when there are a large number of dropped items
- Updated all debug prints for easier reading/understanding
- Helmets now also work as intended
- Fixed some inconsistencies
